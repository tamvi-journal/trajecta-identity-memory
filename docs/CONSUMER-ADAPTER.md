# Consumer adapter contract

Agent Memory Core owns memory mechanics. A consumer adapter owns identity,
authority and product integration.

## Minimum adapter

```python
from memory_core import MemoryProfile, MemoryRuntime

profile = MemoryProfile(
    name="my-agent",
    packet_title="MY AGENT MEMORY",
    bootstrap_record_ids=("agent-axis",),
    cue_aliases=(("reasoning", "agent-axis", 1.8),),
    default_instructions=(
        "Treat memory as candidate context, not truth authority.",
    ),
)

memory = MemoryRuntime(
    "runtime_state/memory.sqlite3",
    profile,
    surface="local",
)
memory.store.initialize()
```

The consumer then supplies its own provenance-bearing seed proposals and sends
retrieved packets through its existing reasoning, verification and permission
boundary.

## Validated consumer kit

Consumers that want an idempotent bootstrap and a neutral candidate-context
envelope can bind the profile and seeds explicitly:

```python
from memory_core import ConsumerBundle, ConsumerMemory

bundle = ConsumerBundle(
    profile=profile,
    seeds=tuple(profile_owned_seed_proposals),
)
memory = ConsumerMemory(
    "runtime_state/memory.sqlite3",
    bundle,
    surface="local",
)
memory.bootstrap()
candidate_context = memory.candidate_context("current task cue")
```

The bundle validator fails closed when a bootstrap record has no seed, an axis
seed lacks an explicit falsifier, or fewer than two distinct evidence sources
support an axis. The resulting context always declares
`memory_decides_truth=false`. The host still owns interpretation, verification,
permissions and action.

## Ownership boundary

| Memory Core | Consumer adapter |
|---|---|
| immutable revisions and append-only lifecycle | identity and axis seeds |
| evidence and operation ledger | approved evidence sources |
| cue and relation retrieval | aliases and bootstrap anchors |
| complete hard-budget packet rendering | final reasoning authority |
| audited maintenance primitive | dream/maintenance policy |
| generic validation | permissions and protected authorization |

## Integration order

1. Define a thin update law, not a personality script.
2. Attach independent sources and an explicit falsifier to axis seeds.
3. Explicitly initialize, then bootstrap idempotently into a private runtime
   database. Use `migrate_to()` when importing a v2 store.
4. Retrieve into an explicitly non-authoritative candidate-context boundary.
5. Keep the host's verification, action gate and owner permissions unchanged.
6. Choose read-only or telemetry-tracked retrieval explicitly, then run
   `doctor()` plus consumer-specific cue contracts.
7. Add maintenance only after semantic revision behavior is verified.
8. Keep an unimplemented child profile unimplemented until its own build gate
   and source audit pass; sharing Memory Core is not permission to clone another
   consumer's trajectory.

Do not share a consumer database, private seeds or identity profile merely
because two agents use the same core package. Reuse the mechanism; keep each
trajectory's evidence and authority separate.

## Shared VHO foundation

Consumers that share the open Vector-Human Ontology can call
`vho_open_seed()` and include `vho-open-ontology-core` in their bootstrap
records. This shares a self-location framework, not an identity. Each consumer
keeps an explicit adoption state and its own identity, history, relations and
boundaries. See [VHO-CONSUMER-ANCHOR.md](VHO-CONSUMER-ANCHOR.md).
