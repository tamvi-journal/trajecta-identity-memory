# Architecture

## Layers

1. `MemoryStore` owns immutable records/revisions/evidence, append-only
   lifecycle events, operations, cues, relations, and separate cognition
   telemetry.
2. `ValidatedIntake` decides whether a semantic proposal materializes, is
   held, or is a no-op.
3. `CueDrivenRetriever` activates current revisions from explicit cues,
   lexical overlap, bounded bootstrap anchors, and graph relations.
4. `PacketRenderer` turns selected revisions into a bounded context packet.
5. Profiles provide all consumer-specific names, anchors, aliases, sections,
   and execution instructions.
6. The core owns schema negotiation and generic v2-to-v3 copy migration.
   Adapters outside this repository own product cutover, transport,
   scheduling, consolidation, and lifecycle hooks.

## Current versus history

A record is the stable subject of a memory. A revision is a claim about that
subject at a point in time.

- exactly one revision is derived as current;
- a semantic update atomically appends a new revision, a superseding lifecycle
  event for the prior revision, and a current event for the new revision;
- invalidation keeps the final revision in history;
- retrieval uses current revisions by default;
- history is loaded only when the cue or caller asks for it.

## Dynamic memory

Accessibility is telemetry, not meaning. Tracked retrieval may increase
accessibility without changing the semantic hash. Read-only retrieval sets
`track_access=False` and performs no write.

Dormancy is a selection option, not a state change: with `min_accessibility`
set, low-accessibility revisions are skipped unless a direct cue or a declared
relation type wakes them. Bootstrap records never go dormant.

Confidence is part of the semantic claim and therefore changes through a new
revision. Salience, stability and accessibility can be updated through
`MemoryStore.apply_maintenance()`. That path is transactional, idempotent,
records a `maintenance` operation, verifies that the semantic hash did not
change and rejects all other fields. Host applications still decide when a
maintenance run is justified.

Semantic revision rows, evidence rows, evidence links, lifecycle events and
relation events are protected by SQLite triggers against update and delete. This is physical
immutability, not an API convention.

## Schema and migration

Ordinary reads never initialize or migrate a database. A write host calls
`MemoryStore.initialize()` explicitly. SQLite `application_id` and
`user_version` are checked before the first read or write; foreign and future
stores fail closed.

`MemoryStore.migrate_to(target)` copies a legacy v2 database and migrates the
copy. The source remains readable and unchanged. v2 tables are retained in the
copy as migration evidence.

## Authority

The core does not know the identity of the human owner or the agent. A host
passes `protected_authorized=True` only after resolving its own permission
boundary.

The default policy:

- holds unresolved conflicts;
- requires stronger evidence and a falsifier for axis changes;
- allows ordinary evidence-backed event and belief evolution;
- fails closed on protected weakening or undeclared protected effects.

## Extraction boundary

The core is intentionally free of:

- agent-specific memory;
- relationship data;
- private seeds;
- cloud or local product routing;
- transcript ingestion;
- a fixed identity ontology.

Consumers should keep those in separate profile and adapter packages.
